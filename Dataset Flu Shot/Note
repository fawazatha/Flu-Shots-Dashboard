#Disclaimer all of the data is synthetically generated (i.e. fake), and comes from a project called Synthea. No real patient data was used in this lesson.
And also there's one dataset that i cannot upload here cause the size is too large for github, but you can find all the dataset on the link from data wizardry https://datawizardry.academy/p/sql_basics_healthcare
