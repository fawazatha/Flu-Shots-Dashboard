# FluShot Insights Dashboard for 2022
Note all of the data is synthetically generated (i.e. fake), and comes from a project called Synthea. No real patient data was used in this lesson.

# Overview
The FluShot Insights Dashboard for 2022 is a data analysis and visualization project to provide comprehensive insights into flu vaccination trends within our hospital's active patient population. By leveraging SQL data preparation techniques and Tableau for visualization, this project addresses the need to monitor and analyze flu shot distribution, patient demographics, and overall vaccination progress throughout 2022.
The primary objectives of this project remain the same:
- Patient Stratification: The dashboard will categorize synthetic patients based on age, race, and county (with geographical representation on a map) to offer a holistic understanding of vaccination patterns among different demographics.
- Running Total Analysis: The dashboard will display a running total of flu shots administered over the course of 2022 using the synthetic data.
- Total Flu Shots: A clear count of the total number of flu shots given in 2022, based on the synthetic data, will be provided to assess the overall impact of our virtual vaccination efforts.
- Individual Patient Insights: The dashboard will include a list of synthetic patients indicating whether each synthetic patient received a flu shot in 2022. This information is essential for monitoring individual patient vaccination status within the synthetic context.
- The requirement for this project remains consistent: patients must have been "Active at our hospital" within the specified date range, as defined by the synthetic data. This ensures that the analysis focuses on relevant synthetic patient data.

In summary, the FluShot Insights Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for demonstrating data analysis and visualization skills using synthetically generated data. It showcases the application of SQL data preparation techniques and the creation of a meaningful Tableau dashboard, which can be further extended to real-world scenarios with actual patient data for more accurate insights.
