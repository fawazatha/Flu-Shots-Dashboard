# FluShot Insights Dashboard for 2022
Note all of the data is synthetically generated (i.e. fake), and comes from a project called Synthea. No real patient data was used in this lesson.

# Overview
The FluShot Insights Dashboard for 2022 is a data analysis and visualization project to provide comprehensive insights into flu vaccination trends within our hospital's active patient population. By leveraging SQL data preparation techniques and Tableau for visualization, this project addresses the need to monitor and analyze flu shot distribution, patient demographics, and overall vaccination progress throughout 2022.
The primary objectives of this project remain the same:
- Patient Stratification: The dashboard will categorize synthetic patients based on age, race, and county (with geographical representation on a map) to offer a holistic understanding of vaccination patterns among different demographics.
- Running Total Analysis: The dashboard will display a running total of flu shots administered over the course of 2022 using the synthetic data.
- Total Flu Shots: A clear count of the total number of flu shots given in 2022, based on the synthetic data, will be provided to assess the overall impact of our virtual vaccination efforts.
- Individual Patient Insights: The dashboard will include a list of synthetic patients indicating whether each synthetic patient received a flu shot in 2022. This information is essential for monitoring individual patient vaccination status within the synthetic context.
- The requirement for this project remains consistent: patients must have been "Active at our hospital" within the specified date range, as defined by the synthetic data. This ensures that the analysis focuses on relevant synthetic patient data.

In summary, the FluShot Insights Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for demonstrating data analysis and visualization skills using synthetically generated data. It showcases the application of SQL data preparation techniques and the creation of a meaningful Tableau dashboard, which can be further extended to real-world scenarios with actual patient data for more accurate insights.

# Tableau Dashboard
Here are the main insights or findings from the dashboard:
- The distribution of flu shots was not uniform across all counties. Some counties had a much higher number of flu shots given than others. This may be due to a number of factors, such as the population size of the county, the availability of flu shots, and the outreach efforts of local health departments.
- The number of flu shots given increased steadily throughout the months. This is also good news, as it shows that the flu vaccination program is gaining momentum. The peak number of flu shots was given in November, which is typically the month when the flu season is at its peak.
- The flu shot compliance rate was high overall, with all races and age groups having a compliance rate of at least 80%. This is good news, as it shows that the flu vaccination program is reaching a large number of people.

# Acknowledgment
I would like to acknowledge the Synthea project (https://synthea.mitre.org/) for providing the synthetic healthcare data used in this project. Additionally, I thank the Data Wizardry website (https://datawizardry.academy/p/sql_basics_healthcare) for facilitating access to the synthetic dataset. This project relies on synthetic data, ensuring privacy and ethical considerations are maintained while allowing us to develop and showcase data analysis and visualization skills.

Please note that all data used in this project is synthetically generated and does not contain real patient information. It is intended solely for educational and demonstration purposes.
